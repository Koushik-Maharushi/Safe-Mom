SafeMom aims to develop a machine learning-based predictive model to assess pregnancy risks by analyzing factors like age, blood pressure, and blood sugar levels. Unlike current systems that rely on manual generalized guidelines, the model will provide accurate, individualized risk predictions by identifying complex patterns. Using algorithms such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), the system will be optimized through hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering. The goal is to support healthcare providers with actionable insights for timely interventions, improving decision-making in maternal healthcare.
